# Banana-Monkeys

Banana Monkeys is a fun and elegant puzzle game involving the collection of bananas while traversing atop trees.
The goal of each level is to reach the end star mounted on a single tree while also collecting all possible bananas on the level.

The game starts out incredibly simple, but soon the complexity of the concepts and mechanics become clear through increasingly
difficult level design.  Expect to spend 5-10 minutes per level planning out potential routes and executing them carefully.
